  A <strong><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole" target = "_blink" title = "black hole_wikipedia">
  black hole</a></strong> is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that
  nothing—no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light—can
  escape from it.[6] The theory of general relativity predicts that
  a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.
  [7][8] The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is
  called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous
  effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has
  no locally detectable features.[9] In many ways, a black hole acts like
  an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.[10][11] Moreover, quantum
  field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking
  radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely
  proportional to its mass. This temperature is on the order of billionths of
  a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass, making it essentially impossible to observe.
