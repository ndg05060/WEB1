  <p>A <strong><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf" target =

     also called a degenerate dwarf, is a stellar core remnant
    composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense:
    its mass is comparable to that of the Sun, while its volume is comparable
    to that of Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission
    of stored thermal energy; no fusion takes place in a white dwarf.[1]
    The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years,
    the smaller component of the Sirius binary star.
    There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star
    systems nearest the Sun.[2] The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first
     recognized in 1910.[3]:1 The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten
     in 1922.
