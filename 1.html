  <p>A <strong><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star"
  target = "_blank" title = "neutron star_wikipedia">neutron star</a></strong> is the collapsed core of
  a giant star which before collapse had
  a total mass of between 10 and 29 solar masses. Neutron stars are the smallest
  and densest stars, excluding black holes and hypothetical white holes, quark stars,
  and strange stars.[1] Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi)
  and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses.[2]  They result from
  the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse,
  that compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei.</p>

  <p>Once formed, they no longer actively generate heat, and cool over time;
  however, they may still evolve further through collision or accretion.
  Most of the basic models for these objects imply that neutron stars are composed
  almost entirely of neutrons (subatomic particles with no net electrical charge and
  with slightly larger mass than protons); the electrons
  and protons present in normal matter combine to produce neutrons at the conditions
  in a neutron star. Neutron stars are partially supported against further collapse
  by neutron degeneracy pressure, a phenomenon described by the Pauli exclusion principle,
  just as white dwarfs are supported against collapse by electron degeneracy pressure.
  However neutron degeneracy pressure is not by itself sufficient to hold up an object
  beyond 0.7M☉[3][4] and repulsive nuclear forces play a larger role
  in supporting more massive neutron stars.
  [5][6] If the remnant star has a mass exceeding the
  Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit of around 2 solar masses,
  the combination of degeneracy pressure and nuclear forces is insufficient
  to support the neutron star and it continues collapsing to form a black hole.</p>
